# Legacy input compatibility

The input reader targets the two-dimensional environment syntax accepted by Acoustics Toolbox `v2023.5`.

Implemented:

- Fortran list-directed records used by legacy inputs
- quoted and unquoted fields, commas, `!` comments, `/` termination, repetition, null values, and `D` exponents
- legacy vector subtabulation and sorting
- `N/C/P/S/Q/A` SSP selection
- supported boundary, attenuation, run, receiver-grid, source, and beam options
- development-mode single-beam selection
- range-dependent `.ssp` matrices
- short and long, piecewise-linear and curvilinear `.ati`/`.bty` boundary data
- `.brc`/`.trc` magnitude and phase tables
- BOUNCE/KRAKEN `.irc` impedance-function tables for a precalculated bottom reflection condition
- `.sbp` source beam patterns
- same-directory, same-stem auxiliary-file resolution through `load_case`
- semantic validation without invoking the numerical solver

Numerically implemented:

- deterministic single-threaded `R` ray traces
- `N/C/P/S/Q/A` sound-speed evaluation and derivatives
- reference modified polygon/midpoint integration with interface and boundary step reduction
- flat, piecewise-linear, curvilinear, and range-dependent boundaries
- vacuum, rigid, acousto-elastic, grain-size, angularly tabulated, and precalculated internal-impedance reflection conditions
- source beam-pattern weighting and reflection amplitude/phase accumulation
- `E` eigenray and `A/a` arrival calculations for Cartesian/ray-centered geometric-hat (`G/g`) and Cartesian geometric-Gaussian (`B`) beams
- simple-Gaussian (`S`) eigenray detection
- coherent, semi-coherent, and incoherent (`C/S/I`) pressure fields
- geometric-hat (`G/g`), Cartesian geometric-Gaussian (`B`), simple-Gaussian (`S`), and Cartesian/ray-centered Cerveny (`C/R`) field influence
- Cerveny space-filling, minimum-width, and WKB epsilon selection; image beams, windows, branch cuts, and boundary-curvature conditions
- point and line source scaling, rectilinear and irregular receiver grids, caustic phases, arrival combination, and strongest-arrival retention

Unavailable because the corresponding reference paths are incomplete:

- `W` table generation: BELLHOP v2023.5 only prints that it is writing an IRC file; it has no generator, does not read a layered medium for this option, and reaches its unknown-boundary error if a ray reflects
- simple-Gaussian arrival influence and Cerveny eigenray/arrival combinations; reference BELLHOP's corresponding influence paths do not emit these products
- ray-centered geometric-Gaussian (`b`) influence; this option is also explicitly unimplemented by reference BELLHOP

Three-dimensional options are rejected explicitly.

The complete case loader has also been exercised against 69 two-dimensional environments invoked by the official `v2023.5` MATLAB test scripts, including all auxiliary files they request. `tests/MunkRot/MunkRot.env` is intentionally rejected because its run type explicitly selects three-dimensional behavior.
